            <p>I am a highly self-motivated and self taught software developer with 1 year, 6 months of learning and practical experience.
                 I graduated as a developer with CodeX where I enrolled as a trainee software developer. 
                 I began my professional career with Binary Innovative Technology Solutions in 2023, 
                I have gained knowledge and experience in Quality Assurance engineering & FullStack Development..</p>


                <p>In 2023, I embarked on my professional career with Binary Innovative Technology Solutions, 
                    where I have been able to apply my skills in real-world projects. 
                    My role has allowed me to gain valuable experience in both Quality Assurance engineering and Full Stack Development. 
                    I have been involved in the entire software development lifecycle, from requirement gathering and design to implementation and testing. 
                    This experience has honed my ability to write clean,
                    efficient code and to ensure high-quality deliverables through rigorous testing practices.
                    Throughout my journey, I have developed a strong understanding of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and RESTful APIs. 
                    I am also well-versed in version control systems like Gitlab/Gihub,
                    which enables me to collaborate effectively with team members on various projects.</p>

                <p>In addition to my technical skills, I pride myself on my problem-solving abilities and my capacity to learn quickly.
                     I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions.
                     I am continually seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies
                     My goal is to contribute to impactful projects that drive technology forward while fostering a collaborative and dynamic work environment</p>
